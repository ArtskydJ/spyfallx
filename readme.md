## To run locally

Install [DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.html).  Extract it somewhere like `~/dynamodb_local_latest`

Run DynamoDB locally in some terminal tab:

```sh
java -Djava.library.path=~/dynamodb_local_latest/DynamoDBLocal_lib -jar ~/dynamodb_local_latest/DynamoDBLocal.jar -sharedDb
```

Clone the repo, install, run:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:TehShrike/spyfallx.git
cd spyfallx
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:8888/` in your browser.

### To run the tests

There aren't a lot of tests, but hey, there are some.

```sh
npm install
npm test
```
